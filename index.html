But sometimes, medical malpractice or sexual misconduct complaints are unfounded, and the review process can unfairly result in suspension or revocation of your hard-earned license to practice in Minnesota. State laws give the Minnesota Board of Medical Practice authority to order a medical professional to pay for the investigation, court costs and civil penalties and can order a physician to stop performing procedures or offering treatment for their patients. A thorough review is required before the board may take any action</p> <p class="font-3 fs-18">Similarly, state law empowers the Minnesota Board of Nursing to take action against registered nurses (RNs) and licensed practical nurses (LPNs) for a wide range of alleged violations, including failing to renew their license or reregistering, falsified patient records, substance addiction and even failure to pay their taxes or child support. An RN or LPN can only be subject to the board’s disciplinary actions if they sign a consent order or following a formal hearing that finds you are in violation of a statute or rule.</p> <p class="font-3 fs-18">Facing a complaint can be a daunting, complicated process and one you do not have to face on your own. When your professional reputation and career are on the line, our experienced board license attorneys can assist you.</p> </div> <div class="banner-2-right"> <img src="/Mask%20Group%20240.9908c139.png" alt> </div> </section> <section class="simple-block"> <div class="align-center flex-col simple-block-content"> <h2 class="font-7 font-secondary fs-40">Our Employment Lawyers Protect Your Workplace Rights</h2> <p class="font-3 fs-18">State and federal laws govern employer relations with their employees or potential employees. But sometimes, employers are so focused on productivity or do not understand their responsibilities that an employee finds themself in the midst of workplace anxiety despite protected rights. If you believe you were qualified for a promotion, but the position was given to a younger coworker, you could be contending with age discrimination. If your boss or the company’s owner is treating you poorly after you reported their illegal activity, you may be facing whistleblower retaliation.</p> <p class="font-3 fs-18">Our employment attorneys have the experience you need to sift through permissible and impermissible employer behavior and working conditions and make informed decisions. We can help you develop a strategy for achieving a favorable outcome. We can also assist you with reviewing or representing your interests when it comes to a severance agreement. </p> </div> </section> <section class="testimonials"> <div class="flex testimonials-container"> <div class="test-slide"> <h2 class="font-7 font-secondary fs-30">Testimonials</h2> <div id="test-owl" class="owl-carousel"> <div class="block containt"> <p class="font-3 fs-25">“When I was looking for an attorney, I came across Law Office of Sivertson and Barrette, P.A.’s website which said the firm takes the tough cases no matter how powerful the entity on the other side.
